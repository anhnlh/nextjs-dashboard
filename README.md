# Next.js App Router Course ↗️
Taught myself website development using Next.js by following the [course](https://nextjs.org/learn) on Vercel's Next.js website. The finished website is currently deployed using Vercel's service [here](https://nextjs-dashboard-mu-ivory-26.vercel.app/). Use `user@nextmail.com:123456` to log in and play with the application. If there is an error, it's probably because some bad actor maxed out my free database on Vercel. Feel free to notify me to refresh the database.

## Learning points 📚
- Routing
- `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx`
- Data fetching
- Static vs Dynamic rendering
- Partial Prerendering (Next.js 14)
- Streaming individual components
- Search and pagination via Next.js
- Data mutation using Server Actions (in place of API endpoints)
- Error handling with `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx`
- Form accessibility and validation (client- & server-side)
- Authentication using `NextAuth.js`, `middleware.ts`, and `bcrypt`
- Metadata using Next.js Metadata API
